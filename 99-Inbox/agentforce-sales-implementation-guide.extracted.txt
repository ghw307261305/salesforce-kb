Product Knowledge
Associate the agent with the

It takes a few hours for all 
uploaded ﬁles to be ready for 
agent preview. Therefore, if 
you have not pre-created the 
library and uploaded ﬁles, 
expect some delay in the 
uploaded knowledge to be 
available for the agent.

Product Knowledge
Test your agent responses! You

Identify key stakeholders: 
❏
Who will be creating and testing the agent? 
❏
Who will be using the agent in production?
❏
Who will be reviewing agent output and deciding whether 
additional outreach customization will be required?
❏
If customization is required, who will be customizing, testing, and 
reviewing the prompts? 
❏
Determine which leads will be given to the work and how to segment them
❏
Determine what types of questions the agent should answer, and prepare the 
knowledge ﬁles to train the agent
❏
Provision a new email address on 
your company’s domain to be used 
solely by the agent.

What are Topics 
and Instructions?
A topic is a set of instructions (and optionally, actions) that 
make up the jobs an agent can do. Instructions help with the 
generation, formatting, and sequencing of our response and 
conversation.
The Classiﬁcation 
Description 
describes the job of 
the topic and what 
kinds of user 
messages should 
trigger it.
Generally, focus on 
Instructions for 
changes to the 
content and tone of 
your emails.
The Scope sets 
boundaries for what 
the agent is capable 
of doing within the 
same topic.

Personalization 
Parameters & 
Language
Indirectly use the recipient's industry and title to

speciﬁc factual challenges or relevant 
responsibilities tied to their industry and title. 
Avoid generic language and buzzwords or phrases.

already owns Welo products and/or

Guardrail Language
Content Considerations
Things to Avoid
Use “must” instead of “should”
When customizing instructions, here is language that really works! 
Use “strictly” for a strong command
Use “within” + [character count] to 
control content length
Format guardrails as “you” + “must” + verb 
Be speciﬁc about language or 
sentences you want or don’t want (e.g. 
“Never ask rhetorical questions.”)
Use “always” when you want consistency
Overediting the Classiﬁcation 
Description or Scope, as it may cause 
the incorrect email to be sent
Use strong verbs like “don’t” and “stop” 
Encourage LLM to have variety with the 
descriptor “creative” 
Use “never” for absolute guardrails
Including too many few-shot 
examples, which may constrain the 
model’s ability to generate unique and 
personalized messaging

Engage Leads in Multiple Languages 
Reach a broader, global audience
-
Option 1: Build multiple agents and set 
diﬀerent languages during set up, assigning 
leads to diﬀerent agents depending on 
language.
-
Option 2: The agent generally responds to 
diﬀerent languages in that same language, so 
simply adjust instructions as needed and make 
sure to account for cultural diﬀerences with 
respect to tone, diction, formality, and more. 
However, your Initial Outreach email will 
remain in the set language.

hits this limit, it will stop sending emails for the day. 
●
When automating assigning records to the Lead Nurturing agent, ensure that no more than 30 
records are activated at once.  Bulk activations should occur in batches of 30, separated by at least 2 
minutes.  
●
Users do not have governance or prioritization controls around the agent’s emails. For example,  
users can’t tell the agent to prioritize replies over nudges.
●
A meeting booking link is present in all replies if Salesforce Inbox is enabled. 
○
See slides to see how to enable Salesbox Inbox. Otherwise, the agent shares the lead owner’s 
email address only when handing oﬀ to the lead owner.

Common Errors & Troubleshooting
for Sales Development   


===== PAGE 123 =====
Delays
●
Server backlog leads to delay in email processing & send (emails send when backlog is processed)
Failure to Send Email
●
Agent’s User Record email address does not match the connected Account email address in Agent 
Builder → impacts Nudges & Replies
●
Reusing email address between 2 separate EAC Users → impacts Replies
●
Reusing connected email address between the agent and another EAC User → impacts Replies (see 
image)
●
Reusing email address across multiple leads assigned to the agent → occasional issues with Replies
●
Sender & recipient have same email domain (classiﬁes as internal email) → impacts all messages

===== PAGE 124 =====
Emails not shared with you issue
●
If you see this issue “Emails are not shared with you…” on the Activity Timeline, this is probably 
because Activity Sharing setting is set to “Don’t Share”
●
Fix: Edit the rules of engagement setting for the agent inside Agent Builder and click save. This will 
update the Activity Sharing setting for the agent user to public.

Adding Trusted URLs to Your Agentic Outreach:
Salesforce has begun enforcement of Trusted URL allowlists for Agentforce and Einstein Generative AI agents. This update is part of our ongoing eﬀorts to strengthen 
customer environments. An admin-controlled allowlist will prevent agents from generating unapproved URLs aﬀecting images or content from external domains or 
links to external documentation or third-party systems. If a domain is not on your Trusted URL list, the link will be blocked.
What Action Do I Need to Take?
●
Immediately add any external URLs your agents rely on to your Salesforce Trusted URLs list or to the agent's instructions.
●
This includes links to things like external feedback forms, knowledge bases, or any third-party websites.
How to Add Trusted URLs:
1.
Navigate to Setup.
2.
In the Quick Find box, search for and select Trusted URLs.
3.
Click New Trusted URL.
4.
Enter the URL (e.g., https://forms.google.com). You can use a wildcard (*) like *.example.com.
5.
Select the appropriate CSP directives (e.g., img-src for images).
6.
Ensure you have "Customize Application" and "Modify All Data" permissions.
How to Use Agent Instructions:
1.
Open the agent in Agent Builder.
2.
In the agent instructions, add the URLs you want to allow. Note that these must be exact URLs and cannot contain wildcards.
