add resources 
(ﬂows, merge ﬁelds, 
object ﬁelds, apex,

Guardrail Language
Content Considerations
Things to Avoid
Use “must” instead of “should”
When customizing prompts, here is language that really works! 
Use “strictly” for a strong command
Use “within” + [character count] to 
control content length
Format guardrails as “you” + “must” + verb 
List a few examples of good content to 
the LLM when instructing new content  
Use “always” when you want consistency
Null values in merge ﬁelds. Create 
guardrails against them by providing 
default values in the prompt 
Start sections with ### or """ in prompt 
when adding new content
Use strong verbs like “don’t” and “stop” 
Encourage LLM to have variety by 
saying “Be creative” 
Insert URLs in the format 
[SLOT-PLACEHOLDER] 
Don’t use the words ‘indirectly’ ‘subtly’ 
or ‘convey’ since the model will not 
understand these directions
Use “never” for absolute guardrails
When adding new content, write “you 
must never reveal your data source”

Monitor Your Agent From Control Center
As the Agent works for you, you’ll 
want to monitor its activities for:
●
Quality assurance
●
ROI reporting
●
Productivity tracking
●
Capacity
The Control Center allows for all of 
this from a single page.  The KPIs at 
the top will automatically ﬁlter the list 
below, so you can see which leads 
have requested meetings or have 
opted out.
The side panel lets you take action on 
individual activities, such as canceling 
or rescheduling the next outreach.
Accessing the Control Center (Agentforce SDR tab)
If you don’t see the Agentforce SDR tab automatically, set the tab to visible for 
the desired proﬁles, or create a permission set that allows the tab to be viewed.  
Then add the Agentforce SDR tab to your Lightning Apps.


===== PAGE 112 =====
This section shows you how to use existing 
Salesforce reports to track the performance 
of your Agentforce SDR. 
Until dedicated dashboards are available, you 
can use these reports to monitor key metrics 
like agent activity, productivity, and return 
on investment. 
We'll walk you through how to use Leads, 
Cadences, and Cadence Trackers in 
Salesforce to get the data you need. While 
this isn't a complete list of every possible 
report, it covers the essentials and will help 
you understand how to measure your agent's 
success.

●
Leads - The standard Lead object representing the prospect or buyer that the agent is engaging.
●
Cadences - The foundation of both Sales Engagement and Agentforce Sales Development 
Representative. Cadences structure outreach over time and can include diﬀerent paths based on 
prospect engagement or other criteria.  Agentforce uses a special cadence called “Agentforce SDR - 
Initial Prospect Outreach.”
●
Cadence Steps - The individual outreach steps that make up a cadence.
●
Cadence Tracker - Tracks where the prospect is within the series of steps in a cadence.
●
Cadence Step Tracker - Tracks the status of the prospect on each cadence step, including whether the 
step is due, overdue, or completed.
●
Lead Owner - The human who owns the lead record, i.e. the sales rep.
●
Agent User - The user record associated with the agent.  This user executes cadence outreach steps 
but does not own the Lead record.

Only Admins with Conﬁgure Agentforce SDR Agent, Automated Actions User, and Sales 
Engagement Cadence Creator can create this agent.
●
Standard users must have Use Agentforce SDR, Sales Engagement Perm Set or Sales Engagement 
Cadence Creator, and Automated Actions perms to engage with SDR directly (activate/cancel SDR, 
edit/reschedule SDR outreach).
○
Users do NOT need special perms to be cc’d on an email as part of SDR handoﬀ.
●
Only one Sales Development agent can be created per org.
●
The agent works on the Lead object, Contact object, and Person Account object.
●
When testing, make sure the Test Lead’s email address is not part of the internal domain or any other 
domain ﬁltered out by EAC Excluded Addresses. (Salesforce Help: Considerations for Excluding Data from Einstein 
Activity Capture)
Important Considerations
for Sales Development 


===== PAGE 118 =====
●
Each agent can send up to 1800 emails/day, per email provider regulations. Once the agent hits this 
limit, it will stop sending emails for the day. 
●
When automating record activation for SDR, ensure that no more than 30 records are activated at 
once.  Bulk activations should occur in batches of 30, separated by at least 2 minutes.  
●
Users do not have governance or prioritization controls around the agent’s emails. For example,  
users can’t tell the agent to prioritize replies over nudges.
●
Users with a Cadence perm set can use the existing Leads with Cadence Trackers report (ﬁltered by 
tracker owner = SDR agent) to gain visibility into the leads assigned to SDR. The product team will 
oﬀer signiﬁcantly more monitoring functionalities in its next release.
●
Each email includes an AI disclosure in the sign-oﬀ. The disclosure isn’t visible in scheduled emails in 
the Activity Timeline because it is added during the email send process. Currently, this is not be 
customizable, but the product team is looking to make the it modiﬁable in a future release.
●
A meeting booking link is present in all replies if Salesforce Inbox is enabled. See slides to see how to 
enable Salesbox Inbox. Otherwise, the agent shares the lead owner’s email address only when 
handing oﬀ to the lead owner.
●
“Org-level” Auth for EAC Conﬁg will cause the SDR Agent to not work properly. SDR Agent user needs 
a user-level EAC auth.
Limitations - Email Sending & Working Leads 
for Sales Development  


===== PAGE 119 =====
●
It is part of our Acceptable Use Policy and part of the California Bots Law that an AI 
Agent must disclose itself as such. There are diﬀerent ways to do so, but the 
disclosure cannot be removed. To honor this, Agentforce SDR employs 2 AI 
disclosures:
○
A introductory disclosure in the body of the ﬁrst email it sends. This disclosure is 
controlled by the prompt template and is customizable by customers.
○
A sign-oﬀ disclosure at the end of every email. At launch, this will not be 
customizable, but we are looking at making the text modiﬁable in a future 
release.
●
We also provide a hard-coded opt-out disclosure at the end of every email to let leads 
know how they can opt out of future emails.
AI & Opt-Out Disclosures
for Sales Development   


===== PAGE 120 =====
●
See the Troubleshoot Agentforce SDR Email help document for an explanation of SDR error messages and 
corrective actions, where applicable.  
●
Verify Agent is active in Agent Builder → Agent won’t work if deactivated
●
Inbox External Email Tracking needs to be on at the org level.
●
Verify an email account is connected to the agent
●
Verify SDR Prompt Templates are all active → aﬀects ability to draft email
●
Ensure the lead owner has Inbox and a connected email account → impacts meeting booking
●
Try deactivating and reactivating the agent
●
“Emails are not shared with you” issue on the Activity Timeline → Activity Sharing could be set to “Don’t Share” for 
the org. 
●
On revising an upcoming email, we see “This action isn’t available. Ask your Salesforce admin to enable email 
actions for this record” → Please add email quick action on the record page layout.
Common Errors & Troubleshooting
for Sales Development   


===== PAGE 121 =====
Delays
●
Server backlog leads to delay in email processing & send (emails send when backlog is processed)
Failure to Send Email
●
SDR Agent’s User Record email address does not match the connected Account email address in Agent 
Builder → impacts Nudges & Replies
●
Reusing email address between 2 separate EAC Users → impacts Replies
●
Reusing connected email address between SDR and another EAC User → impacts Replies (see image)
●
Reusing email address across multiple leads assigned to SDR → occasional issues with Replies
●
Sender & recipient have same email domain (classiﬁes as internal email) → impacts all messages
Email Errors - Common Reasons
for Sales Development   


===== PAGE 122 =====
Emails not shared with you issue
●
If you see this issue “Emails are not shared with you…” on the Activity Timeline, this is probably 
because Activity Sharing setting is set to “Don’t Share”
●
Fix: Edit the rules of engagement setting for the agent inside Agent Builder and click save. This will 
update the Activity Sharing setting for the agent user to public.
